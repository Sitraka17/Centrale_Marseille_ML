Definition:
- A subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.

Types of ML:
1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train models (e.g., regression, classification).
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).
3. Semi-supervised Learning: Combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.
4. Reinforcement Learning: Learns by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative reward (e.g., game playing, robotics).

Key Concepts:
- Features: Individual measurable properties or characteristics of a phenomenon being observed.
- Labels: The output variable in supervised learning that the model is trained to predict.
- Overfitting: When a model learns the training data too well, including noise, leading to poor performance on new data.
- Underfitting: When a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data.

Common Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Neural Networks

Applications:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- Recommender Systems
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Healthcare Diagnostics

Tools & Libraries:
- Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch)
- R (caret, randomForest, xgboost)
