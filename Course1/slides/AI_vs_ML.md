Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are closely related fields, but they are not the same. Here's a precise comparison:

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- **Definition**: AI is a broad field focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and decision-making.
- **Scope**: Encompasses a wide range of technologies and methods, including ML, but also rule-based systems, expert systems, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision.
- **Goal**: To create machines that can perform intelligent tasks autonomously.
- **Examples**: Self-driving cars, chatbots, virtual assistants, and recommendation systems.

### Machine Learning (ML)
- **Definition**: ML is a subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.
- **Scope**: Focused specifically on data-driven learning and prediction. It includes various techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
- **Goal**: To enable systems to improve their performance on a specific task over time with more data.
- **Examples**: Spam filters, image recognition, predictive analytics, and speech recognition.

### Key Differences
1. **Scope and Application**:
   - AI is the overarching field that includes various approaches and technologies for creating intelligent systems.
   - ML is a specific approach within AI, emphasizing the ability to learn from data.

2. **Techniques**:
   - AI can include non-learning-based techniques (e.g., rule-based systems).
   - ML specifically relies on data-driven learning algorithms.

3. **Purpose**:
   - AI aims to create systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence.
   - ML aims to create models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions.

### Relationship
- ML is a critical component of AI. Many modern AI applications are powered by ML techniques, but AI encompasses much more than just ML.

In summary, AI is the broad field dedicated to creating intelligent systems, while ML is a specific approach within that field focused on building models that can learn from and make decisions based on data.
