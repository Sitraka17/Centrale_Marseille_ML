In Apache Airflow, a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a core concept used to represent a workflow. A DAG is a collection of all the tasks you want to run, organized in a way that reflects their dependencies and execution order. 

### Key Elements of a DAG in Airflow:

1. **Tasks**: Individual units of work or operations, defined as instances of operators.
2. **Operators**: Building blocks for the tasks, which define what each task does (e.g., PythonOperator for executing Python code, BashOperator for running bash commands).
3. **Dependencies**: Relationships between tasks that dictate the order in which tasks should be executed. These are represented by edges in the graph.
4. **Schedule**: Specifies when and how often the DAG should run, defined using cron-like syntax or Airflow's timetable classes.

### Characteristics of a DAG:

- **Directed**: Each edge has a direction, indicating the order of task execution.
- **Acyclic**: The graph does not contain cycles, ensuring that there are no loops in the task dependencies, preventing infinite loops.
  
### Example of a Simple DAG:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator
from datetime import datetime

# Define the DAG
dag = DAG(
    'example_dag',
    description='An example DAG',
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    catchup=False
)

# Define tasks
start = DummyOperator(task_id='start', dag=dag)
end = DummyOperator(task_id='end', dag=dag)

# Set task dependencies
start >> end
```

### Explanation:

- **DAG Definition**: The `DAG` object is initialized with parameters such as `description`, `schedule_interval`, `start_date`, and `catchup`.
- **Tasks**: Two `DummyOperator` tasks are created, representing no-op (no operation) tasks just for the sake of example.
- **Dependencies**: The `start` task is set to run before the `end` task using the `>>` operator, defining the flow of execution.

### Practical Use:
In practice, DAGs in Airflow are used to automate complex data pipelines, ensuring tasks are executed in the correct order and can handle dependencies, retries, and other workflow management concerns. This allows for reliable and maintainable orchestration of tasks, often used in data engineering, ETL processes, and machine learning workflows.
