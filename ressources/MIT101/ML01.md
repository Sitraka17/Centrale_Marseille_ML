# Machine Learning: Focus, Challenges, and Key Concepts

## Introduction
The main focus of machine learning is making decisions or predictions based on data. There are a number of other fields with significant overlap in technique, but difference in focus: in economics and psychology, the goal is to discover underlying causal processes and in statistics it is to find a model that fits a data set well. In those fields, the end product is a model. In machine learning, we often fit models, but as a means to the end of making good predictions or decisions.

## Applications of Machine Learning
As machine-learning (ML) methods have improved in their capability and scope, ML has become the best way, measured in terms of speed, human engineering time, and robustness, to make many applications. Great examples are face detection, speech recognition, and many kinds of language-processing tasks. Almost any application that involves understanding data or signals that come from the real world can be best addressed using machine learning.

## The Role of Human Engineering
One crucial aspect of machine learning approaches to solving problems is that human engineering plays an important role. A human still has to frame the problem: acquire and organize data, design a space of possible solutions, select a learning algorithm and its parameters, apply the algorithm to the data, validate the resulting solution to decide whether it's good enough to use, etc. These steps are of great importance.

## The Problem of Induction
The conceptual basis of learning from data is the problem of induction: Why do we think that previously seen data will help us predict the future? This is a serious philosophical problem of long standing. We will operationalize it by making assumptions, such as that all training data are IID (independent and identically distributed) and that queries will be drawn from the same distribution as the training data, or that the answer comes from a set of possible answers known in advance.

## Key Problems in Machine Learning
In general, we need to solve these two problems:

### Estimation
When we have data that are noisy reflections of some underlying quantity of interest, we have to aggregate the data and make estimates or predictions about the quantity. How do we deal with the fact that, for example, the same treatment may end up with different results on different trials? How can we predict how well an estimate may compare to future results?

### Generalization
How can we predict results of a situation or experiment that we have never encountered before in our data set?

## Characteristics of Problems and Solutions
We can describe problems and their solutions using six characteristics, three of which characterize the problem and three of which characterize the solution:

### Problem Characteristics
1. **Problem class:** What is the nature of the training data and what kinds of queries will be made at testing time?
2. **Assumptions:** What do we know about the source
